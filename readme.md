# Image Processing Masks-Convolution

Developing from Scratch Filters that change Images and apply them via Convolution With the purpose to Uderstand the Basics of Image Processing


## In this project it was developed 
1. First and really important goal of the project was to create a function that can take as input an image, filter and has as output a filtered image. This function will be used later in multiple steps throught the project
2. The second step was to create multiple different Filters in the frequency domain and apply them on images
3. Finally directional filters where developed in order to identify the differences and the pros and cons of each filter

## What I learned from this Project
- It was vital to deeply uderstand what is Fourier and how to use it 
- You needed really good handle on both forward and backward Fourirer and how to combine them on an actual peace of software 
- How to filter images from scratch 

## What was the project difficulties 
- Mainly udertanding how to use Fourier transform 
- How to make the code robust for all images

## My solutions
- Instead of trying to uderstand the theory or create the code with a small uderstanding I tried to combine the two. I worked on the code and at the same time I was going back and reading again and again the theory it was a combination of the two that helped a lot at the end of the project
