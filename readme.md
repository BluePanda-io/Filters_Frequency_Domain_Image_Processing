# Image Processing Masks-Convolution

Developing from Scratch Filters that change Images and apply them via Convolution With the purpose to Uderstand the Basics of Image Processing


## In this project it was developed 
1. First and really important goal of the project was to create a function that can take as input an image and a filter and has as output a filtered image, and this function will be used in multiple steps throught the project

## Results of the Project

## What I learned from this Project
- It was vital to deeply uderstand what is Fourier and how to use it 
- You needed really good handle on both forward and backward Fourirer and how to combine them on an actual peace of software 
- How to filter images from scratch 

## What was the project difficulties 
- Mainly udertanding how to use Fourier transform 
- How to make the code robust for all images

## My solutions
- Instead of trying to uderstand the theory or create the code with a small uderstanding I tried to combine the two. I worked on the code and at the same time I was going back and reading again and again the theory it was a combination of the two that helped a lot at the end of the project
